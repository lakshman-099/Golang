# Learn Go

Welcome to the Learn Go repository! This repository is dedicated to helping you learn the Go programming language. Inside this repository, you will find code examples that will help you gain a better understanding of Go programming.
In this repo I am using go version go1.20.4.

## Topics Covered

- **Variables**: Demonstrates how to declare variables in various ways.

- **Functions**: Explains the basic structure of functions and how to call them within other functions.

- **If-Else Conditions**: Provides examples illustrating the usage of if-else statements in Go for making decisions based on different conditions.

- **Switch Case**: Demonstrates the use of switch-case statements in Go for handling multiple conditions. It also explains the fallthrough behavior, which is generally used with constant values in switch-case statements. For more complex conditions, if-else statements are recommended in Go.

- **Loops**: Covers three different types of loops: `for`, `while`, and infinite loops. Includes practical examples for each loop type.

- **Structs**: Explains the concept of structs in Go with simple examples. Also discusses how to define methods for structs.

- **Types**: Provides explanations and examples for various types like arrays, slices, structs, maps, and pointers. Includes common operations on these types.

- **Files**: basic file operations in Go using the `os` package. It includes functions for writing content to a file (`writeToFile`) and reading content from a file (`readFromFile`). These examples demonstrate how to create, open, write, and read files using Go's file handling capabilities
